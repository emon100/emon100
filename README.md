# About myself
Trying to learn a tiny bit of Everything. Once had a deep dive into learning programming languages. Now trying to figure out how distributed systems work.

# What I know
From peers, side-projects, doing schoolwork and internships in Tencent and Alibaba, I gained:
- My Languages Experiences: JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Python, Java, Rust, Go, HTML, CSS, SQL, Racket...
- My Technology Stacks: JavaScript(Node.js, React, Vue, etc), GUI(Qt, Swing, ImGui, etc), Backend(Flask, Gin, Spring Boot, etc), DataBase(PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch)...
- My tiny bits of Domain Knowledge: Using Cloud(VMs, Object Storage, Network, Serverless), Fullstack Development, Compiler Implementation(LLVM, ANTLR), Distributed Storage and Computing(Ceph, HDFS, Hadoop), Functional Programming(Learned by Reading SICP)
